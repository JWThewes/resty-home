# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 25, 2026**

## Overview

RestyHome is a local HomeKit bridge that runs entirely on your device. It does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.

## HomeKit Data

RestyHome accesses your HomeKit home configuration (homes, rooms, accessories, and scenes) solely to expose them via a local-only REST API on your device. This data:

- Never leaves your local network
- Is not transmitted to any external server
- Is not stored on disk (held in memory only while the app is running)
- Is not shared with any third party

The REST API listens only on `localhost` and is not accessible from other devices on your network.

## Data Collection

RestyHome does **not** collect:

- Personal information
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Crash reports
- Location data
- Device identifiers

## Third-Party Services

RestyHome uses no third-party services, SDKs, or analytics frameworks. The app is built entirely with Apple's native frameworks (HomeKit, Network, SwiftUI) and has zero external dependencies.
